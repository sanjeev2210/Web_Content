<p><strong class="light-color-text">How to Sign Up.</strong><br>
To sign up for the Site, you will need to supply to Double Groove LLC your legal name, an electronic point of contact (usually email address) and whatever payment information you are planning to use. There are 2 main types of payment plans on this Site; a basic plan (which is the default plan) and a monthly premium plan. If you decide that you are going to retain a basic (default) bundle you are not going to be invoiced, and your charge card is saved in case you are looking to get additional upgrades (if appropriate). If you choose to, instead, start paying for the monthly premium; that is the only time that you will have any sort of cost on your Payment Method. By requesting a monthly premium plan from the Site and by utilizing the advantages of the Site, you concur that, as part of your repeated monthly premium bundle in the Site you sanction Double Groove LLC or its associate(s) to charge your Payment Method the repeated Double Groove LLC monthly premium cost (plus appropriate taxes) appropriate to your current premium plan (e.g., 1 month, 2 months, 6 months) on the same day during the month, until your Double Groove LLC online monthly premium is canceled or otherwise revoked. For instance, if you have a monthly premium plan, and you started on the 12th of September, you would be charged (via your Payment Method) on the 12th of each subsequent month. If your date is on a day that is not necessarily found every month (say, if you started on the 31st of October), then your charge would occur on the 1st day of the following month (in this case, because there are not 31 days in November, you would be charged the 1st of December instead). You will not get copies of charge slips evidencing the repetitive costs of the monthly payment. You agree to pay the appropriate recurring premium costs (plus any applicable taxes) as indicated by your Payment Method service provider contract. You also sanction Double Groove LLC to charge costs of any kind you can potentially incur connected with your Double Groove LLC monthly premium service.</p>

<p><strong class="light-color-text">Imminent Additional Costs</strong><br>
When your Payment Method is a charge or credit card (the Payment Card), you also permit Double Groove LLC to place a potential cost to your current Payment Card as soon as you register for a payment plan, and before each subsequent monthâs payment. Pending charges that are used to check out your billing address and whether or not your Payment Card is currently valid, are temporary (typically 3 to 7 days in length), and you will not actually have to pay any cost. Those charges will, however, reduce how much credit you have available on your Payment Card, based on how much that holding cost is (usually around $1- $2).</p>

<p><strong class="light-color-text">Costs Relating to your Payment Method.</strong><br>
You alone are responsible for any and all costs that your Payment Method requests you to pay in relationship with your transactions. This includes monthly costs, over limit costs, lack of sufficient funds, and costs related to going over your credit limit. Double Groove LLC is not responsible for any of these costs.</p>

<p><strong class="light-color-text">Promotional Offers.</strong><br>
Occasionally, in Double Groove LLCâs consideration, Double Groove LLC may provide a lessened monthly cost for any services related to the Site, for a specific period of time, to new customers or various other selected persons who already have accounts with the site. If you choose to utilize one of these promotions that are intended for new clients, at the time of creation of your Double Groove LLC account, your Payment Method will still be asked to pay the promotional value, plus appropriate taxes, during this marketing period. For all those marketing offers, you concur that any kind of such lessened costs is only applicable at the time of the specified promotional period, understanding that the regular applicable repeated monthly cost plus appropriate costs and taxes will have to be paid, by way of automatic renewal on your Payment Method, when the promotion has ended. Requirements of the marketing offer, that may include the promotional costs and period of those costs, may be different depending on the offer. Any details of any promotion that are not covered in the Terms and Conditions will remain defined on the web page on which you land before you start your account or as part of the account creation process. Double Groove LLC holds the right to give marketing access to our various other sites to selected subscribers.</p>

Periodically, in Double Groove LLC's decisions, the Site can offer a period of trial to customers that are using the site for the first time. These are limited to one per Payment Method presented, or one per household, based on the circumstances. During these trial promotions, your credit or check card will remain authorized for one month of service plus appropriate taxes, though your Payment Card will not be charged for the duration of the trial period. Other terms of trial offers, that may include the duration of the trial, can vary. Exact details of your trial not covered within the Terms and Conditions will remain defined on the web page that you used to make your account or the page where you saw the offer while making your account. The trial time begins the day you subscribe to Double Groove LLCâs monthly premium service.</p>

This will happen, regardless of how long your trial period is meant to be. Kindly note, prices regarding the service might be different, based on your country of origin, the device that you are using, the services offered, and any related deals. The first day that you get charged following your trial will remain your anniversary date for billing purposes. Your Payment Method will be invoiced the repetitive monthly cost and any kind of appropriate sales tax on the day following the expiration of your trial period, unless you have chosen to cancel your plan at the conclusion of the trial period. In order to make sure that you donât have any charges, you have to make sure that you cancel your monthly plan before your trial period has ended. You wonât get any kind of notification from Double Groove LLC before, or at, the end of your own trial. Keep the expiration date on hand.</p>

These phone numbers are available for use all day, every day. Any plan modifications made to your profile before the trial has ended will make the rest of the trial invalid, and your new plan will be utilized.</p>

<p><strong class="light-color-text">Expiration Date and Refusal of Charges to Your Payment Card</strong><br>

If your card, for any reason, wonât allow Double Groove LLC to charge the monthly cost, you have 9 days to make the card valid. If Double Groove LLC is able to put a charge on your Payment Card (whether itâs the old one or the new one that you have provided) during the 9 day period and any other monthly costs are paid, then you will retain your access without interruption and the charges will be made until the plan is canceled. If Double Groove LLC cannot charge the card (whether itâs the old one or the new one that you have provided), then your benefits will be suspended starting on the 10th day after the payment was declined.

To illustrate, if your trial ends on the 15th of August, and your paid monthly premium starts on the 16th of August, your monthly premium cost gives you access to Double Groove LLC benefits until the 16th of September, and then you will be invoiced on September 16th (which is your anniversary date) for the following period of time (the 17th of September to the 16th of October). You can cancel this at any point, and you wonât be charged. So, for that same example, if you cancel on the 31st of August, you wonât get invoiced on the 16th of September, but you will still have your benefits until the end of the period that you had paid for. To cancel your plan, call 1-877-747-0005 for Canada and the United States, or 1-302-722-4141 for international customers; these numbers are available 7 days a week from 0AM to 12PM.
